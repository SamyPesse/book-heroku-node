# Coding the application

Now that the git repository and the node module structure are setup, we are ready to start coding the application.

This application will be a simple hello world.

### Instaling our dependencies

In node.js, the dependencies are listed in the **package.json** file. All dependencies from this file can be installed using the command `npm install .`.

An other dependency can be installed and added to the package.json using: `npm install name@version --save`.

Our application will depend on: `express@4.3.1`.

So install it using:

```
$ npm install express@4.3.1 --save
```
